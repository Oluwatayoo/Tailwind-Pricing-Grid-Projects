# Tailwind Pricing Grids

This repository contains **6 different pricing grid projects** that i built while practicing **Tailwind CSS**

The idea came after following along with Brad Traversy's Tailwind CSS course when he developed a similar component. Instead of just repeating the tutorial only, I challenged myself by using **Figma Community designs** as references to develop my unique pricing grids.
